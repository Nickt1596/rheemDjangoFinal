Possible Scenarios When Adding a Shipment - ALL TESTS COMPLETED AND WORKS
    a. Only required fields are entered. Then the following happens - TESTED AND WORKS CORRECTLY
        1a. Calculate rateTotal
        1b. Calculate rateTotalCarrier
        1c. Calculate Shipment Margin
        1d. Calculate Shipment Margin Percentage
    b. Required Fields + customCarrierRate is checked - TESTED AND WORKS CORRECTLY
        2a. Calculate rateTotal
        2b. Set rateTotalCarrier = 0.00
        2c. Don't calculate any Margin
    c. Required Fields + Value entered in rateTotalCarrier - This is actually not possible since it isn't available on the form
        3a. Set customCarrierRate to True
        3b. Calculate rateTotal
        3c. Calculate Shipment Margin
        3d. Calculate Shipment Margin Percentage
    d. Required Fields + Trailer Selected - TESTED AND WORKS CORRECTLY
        4a. Follow the steps in scenario a
        4b. Save the shipment entry, then find the trailerTrip that matches the trailer Number, and update
            the trailer trip with the shipment load number.

Possible Scenarios When Editing a Shipment
    a. Carrier Rate is changed - TESTED AND WORKS CORRECTLY
        1a. Set customCarrierRate to True
        1b. Re-calculate Shipment Margin and Percentage.
    b. Trailer Number is changed - TESTED AND WORKS CORRECTLY
        2a. Before saving the entry, find the trailerTrip that matches the old trailer number, and update the trailer
            trip Shipment to NULL
        2b. Save the shipment entry, then update the corresponding TrailerTrip
    c. Rate is changed - Tested and Results below (Need to add in to check if Custom Carrier Rate is True)
        3a. Follow steps from scenario a above. - Properly recalculated

Handling Logic from The Shipments URL

Actions available to the user
Edit Shipment
Change Carrier Rate
Assign Trailer / Change Trailer
Assign Carrier / Change Carrier
Assign Driver / Change Driver
Set Delivery Appointment / Change Delivery Appointment
Set Date Dray PU
Set Date Dray Returned
Set Date Carrier PU
Set Date Delivered
Set Date Carrier Returned

Actions always available
Edit Shipment
Change Carrier Rate

Actions Conditionally Available
Set Date Dray PU
Set Date Dray Returned
Set Date Carrier PU
Set Date Delivered
Set Date Carrier Returned

Actions That Change from Assign to Change
Assign Trailer / Change Trailer
Assign Carrier / Change Carrier
Assign Driver / Change Driver
Set Delivery Appointment / Change Delivery Appointment

Logic for Actions That Change from Assign to Change
    1. If those fields are None, we display Assign. If not none, we display Change.

Logic for Conditionally Available
    1. Set Date Dray PU
        1a. Not displayed until a Trailer has been selected
    2. Logic for the next 3 Set Dates
        1a. If the Current Set Date == None and Prior is not none, then display that action.
    3. Date Delivered Date is set
        1a. Update Shipment to Load Delivered



Trailer Trip Model Breakdown

This model is never user created, for every trailer, there is exactly one Trailer Trip Model Entry

Fields
    shipment
    dateYardEmpty
    dateDrayPickedUp
    dateDrayReturnedLoaded
    dateCarrierPickedUpLoaded
    dateCarrierDelivered
    dateCarrierReturnedEmpty

General Rules
    1. Throw error if a later date field is edited, while an earlier one, is still blank.
        (This may already be handled via the Jinga Logic I have)

TESTED AND COMPLETED
Possible Scenarios when Updating a Trailer Trip
    a. dateCarrierReturnedEmpty is entered and saved.
        1a. Save the Entry
        1b. Create a query of the current Trailer Trip entry
        1c. Generate a Trip Report based on that information
        1d. Reset the Trailer Trip form by doing the following
            1. Assign dateCarrierReturnedEmpty to a variable.
            2. Reset Shipment to None
            3. Set dateYardEmpty to the variable in step 1.
            4. Set all other fields to none
            5. Save



Project Future Implementation Ideas
Tables to Implement in the future
1. Expense Table
2. Rheem Charges
3. Carrier Charges

Expense Table Breakdown
Example expenses
    - Yard Rent (Monthly Reoccuring)
    - Trailer Expenses
    - Trailer Repairs
    - Temp Storage
    - Loadout Cost

Rheem Charges
Example Charges
    - Detention ($40/hr after 3 hours)
    - Reconsignment ($75)
    - Driver-Assist ($100)
    - TONU ($200)
    - Storage Fee's ($50/day after 3 days)

    - Charge Type
    - Load Number
    - BOL Number
    - Trailer Number
    - Date of Occurrence (May be start to end if Storage Fee's)
    - Bool Collected
Logic Ideas
    - If Detention Charge manually enter
    - Reconsignment Charge manually enter
    - Driver-Assist Manually enter
    - TONU Manually enter
    - Store Fee's we can Calculate based off of Trailer Trip
        - When Date Dray Returned Loaded is saved to Trailer Trip
            a. Check if Days between Dray PU and Dray Returned is greater than 3
            b. If so, create an entry into Rheem Charges


Carrier Charges
Example Charges
    - Trailer Rent ($30/Day after 7 days from Date PU to returned Empty)
Fields Needed
    - Amount Owed
    - Days Owed
    - Load Number (From Shipment)
    - Trailer Number (From Trip Report)
    - Carrier Name (From Shipment)
    - Driver Name (From Shipment)
    - Date Trailer Picked Up Loaded (From Trip Report)
    - Date Trailer Returned Empty (From Trip Report)
    - Bool Collected
Ideas
    - Can be calculated by the following
    - When saving a Trip Report, if trailerDaysOwed is > 0
        - Sets Days Owed to trailerDaysOwed
        - Amount Owed = trailerDaysOwed * 30
